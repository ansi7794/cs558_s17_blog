### Preview files locally

If you want to preview your notes locally you'll need to install [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
Then, just run:

	jekyll serve
	
	
#### For Ubuntu:
You will also need to install ruby version >= 2.0.0 and any dependencies that come up.

Then, from the main directory of the repository, just run:

	 bundle exec jekyll serve
	
It will tell you which address to go to in your browser to preview the page (default is http://localhost:4000).
