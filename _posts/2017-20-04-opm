The OPM Data Breach {style="font-size:50px;"}
===================

Abstract
========

On June 4th, 2015, the Washington Post published a reveal that the
United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM) had been hacked and
majorly compromised (Nakashima 06/04/15). As the overseeing body of the
USA's federal employees, the their sensitive personal information
exposed. Furthermore, the article suggests that China was likely to
blame. The following reactions from the media were that of shock and
accusation. The heavy media pressure was so prevalent and ubiquitous
that it likely had a host a negative effects on the as of yet
investigations of the OPM breach. Beyond political sensitivity, all the
technical aspects of the hack are as of yet unknown, but in the
following you will find the vulnerabilities that lead to the hack and
most concretely or likely techniques that were utilized.

OPM Server Framework Overview
=============================

The Office of Personnel Management stores their data on a Microsoft
Windows Server Platform, which is unique because it uses the Active
Directory (AD) architecture. The AD contains a user forest system, which
is almost a forest-like organization of users. Users with highest
credentials (i.e., administrators), are at the top of the user forest.
At the bottom are the lowest login credentials, such as independent
contractors or entry-level workers. If users are part of a user forest,
they can see all other users in the AD and their corresponding
privileges. However, a user cannot access the data unless he has the
proper credentials.. KeyPoint is a government contractor that is in
charge of conducting security clearances on behalf of OPM. After an
internal data breach in which login credentials of several KeyPoint
employees were stolen, the attackers were able to gain initial non-admin
access the OPM network.

Exploiting Microsoft's vulnerabilities
======================================

Active Directory Privilege Escalation is a method from which an attacker
compromises a non-admin account and is able to gain privileges through
attack vectors until eventually becoming root.

Exploiting the LSASS Vulnerability Via Mimikatz
-----------------------------------------------

The Local Security Subsystem Authority Service (LSASS) is in charge of
saving a user's login credentials to memory in order to provide single
sign-on capabilities on the Windows operating system. This program is
executed after a user logs into a server or personal computer. On a
Windows 2008 Server or earlier, the LSASS writes all of the user login
credentials that have logged into the network in the same memory
address. Mimikatz is a software that exploits this vulnerability and
returns a memory dump of all user's credentials that have logged into
the system on the same session. Therefore, after possessing an initial
access to the OPM network, the attackers were able to steal many OPM
employees login information, some of which belonging to admin users.
However, on many systems that run Windows, passwords are not stored in
plaintext inside the Domain Controller -- their NTLM Hash are stored
instead. This prevented the attackers from directly obtaining plaintext
usernames and passwords; instead they would have to exploit another
Windows server vulnerability to compromise the account.

Exploiting the NTLM Authentication Protocol Vulnerability
---------------------------------------------------------

*Figure 2.1: Diagram representing the different procedures of the NTLM
authentication protocol.*

Based on the above diagram, the NTLM Authentication protocol never
verifies the user's plaintext password. Therefore, if an attacker were
to get a user's password as an NTLM hash, along with its username in
plaintext, he could authenticate as his victim. This is called a
**Pass-the-Hash attack**, and it was used by the attackers in order to
compromise admin accounts inside the OPM network after stealing their
hashed passwords.

Installing the Remote Access Trojan
-----------------------------------

After gaining root access into OPM's network, the attackers instaled a
Remote Access Trojan into the machine, which is a malware that
communicates over HTTP to an external network that belongs to the
attacker. Innocuously named after McAfee's software mcutil.dll to fool
sysadmins, the attackers were able to read and steal the SF-86 forms
that were stored inside OPM's network.

Aftermath of the attack
=======================

As a result of this attack, 19.7 million government security applicants
and 1.8 million of their co-habitants, a total of 21.5 million, had
their data compromised. Data that was stolen included addresses, dates
of birth, pay histories, pension information, ages, gender, race, and
fingerprints. In response the former head of OPM, Katherine Archuleta,
was forced to resign. An additional government response to the attack
was to instigate a 30 day security sprint to improve and standardize
security measures across all government organizations.

There are few ways to prevent such an attack from happening. One way is
to use 2-factor authentication. If a person logs into an account, then
the server would send a notification to another device or source from
which the owner of the account can verify the login. If the owner
verifies the login, then the server responds by logging in the user.
Using a 2-factor authentication system would have prevented
pass-the-hash attacks or unauthorized logins, because the owner of the
account would have to approve the login in order for the user to access
the account. Another way that OPM could have prevented the data breach
was to change compromised credentials from KeyPoint. Access to KeyPoint
allowed the hackers to access OPM's Active Directory; preventing hackers
from using stolen credentials would have prevented the entire attack.
The compromised credentials should have been altered or removed to
prevent this breach.

The Various Non-Technical Influences
====================================

Beyond just being technical complexity, the OPM hack is further
complicated because of political influence and the media. First and
foremost, the OPM hack is inherently political. While most hacks have
the straightforward aspect of being for financial gain, this one is
muddled by inscrutable political influence. Though there's still no
consensus, multiple independent security firms believe that the attack
was performed by a possibly state funded Chinese group. The two major
pillars of belief are that China possesses both the capability for the
attack and the ability to leverage to unique stolen data. After all,
independent cyber criminals would have more use for liquid assets, a
government would be more likely to compile dossiers on federal
employees. Any political statement the U.S. publicly releases will be
heavily influenced by pragmatic politics; instead of being objective
information for the public; influenced national power dynamic in other
political arenas. Beyond America, any attempt to apprehend the people
responsible will ultimately have to be Chinese. Given that the Chinese
Government has claimed to have caught the hackers but completely refuses
to release any of their identities, details or techniques of the group,
one might question the legitimacy of those statements (Nakashima
12/02/15). Beyond political effects, the media blitz that followed the
original expose raises troubling issues. It is my personal belief that
the media's deep need for attribution lead to a somewhat substandard job
on the part of independent security companies. Given that the first
major theory for attribution is a group called Deep Panda is responsible
(Krebs) and the second is that it wasn't Deep Panda (Hesseldahl), it
would certainly suggest a lack of proper coordination and peer review
before attribution. I attribute this phenomenon to the media cycle,
making any speculation so lucrative in terms of attracting publicity,
that firms cannot resist making large claims without ample critical
inspection.

Conclusions
===========

There are many implications and take aways from the vast array of events
that spiralled out of the OPM hack. First and foremost is the need for
the US government to use up to date and secure architectures and
machines in all aspects of governing; a wider adoption of two factor
security would also be indispensible. Beyond that, there seems like
there's a definite need to create have a greater independent source for
security analysis. One that can gain access to otherwise classified
government material while simultaneously staying unbeholden to
political, media and market influence. Perhaps the UN could could form
some manner of independent cyber security analyzer team, as
international cooperation in this regards isn't spectacular. Or
independent security companies could come up with some sort of internal
sharing agreement prior to publishing findings, to prevent the public
consumption of wildly dissenting views that they have no ability to
technically process and have to take on faith. Regardless, the OPM hack
and it's aftermath goes to show that there is much ground to cover in
cyber security, not only on the technical level, but on the level of
legislature and public management.
